observations: 
env liar -> will create this error: "env : 'liar' : No such file or directory"
		 -> env should only work on its own with no options or arguments according to project description
		 -> an error would be redundant since it would imply functionality
		 => solution: display nothing if env is being used faulty

pwd liar -> will omit the "liar" suffix and only display the work directory
		=> has been implemented!
		
cd + more than one argument -> "bash: cd: too many arguments" 
		=> has been implemented!
		
still might need to disable cd options such as ".." / "." / and " - " since these aren't relative or absolute paths
		=> error handling implemented!
		
adjusted formatting for bracketed echo flags needed!
		-> example: echo ($(test)) -> syntax error near unexpected token '$(test)'
		=> successfully implemented!

=======================================================================================================================
		
implement proper error handling for "echo (($(test)))" and "echo ($(test)"

typing a valid command within brackets should still run the command, otherwise show an error
=> bash: (pwd) -> prints out current work directory
=> bash: (test) -> prints out "test: command not found"

having a valid command but something behind it should highlight the suffix as a format error
=> bash: (pwd) test -> "bash: syntax error near unexpected token `test'"
=> bash: (pwd) (env) -> "bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('"

if there's a bracket too much (like ')' for instance) you need to highlight it
=> bash: (test)) => "bash: syntax error near unexpected token `)'"
=> this should work no matter if there's a dollar-sign in front or not!
	=> partially implemented, only seems to show off "(" however?
